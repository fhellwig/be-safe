# BE Safe

BE Safe is a prototype application developed by [Buchanan & Edwards](http://www.buchanan-edwards.com) in response to RFQ 4QTFHS150004 issued by the General Services Administration (GSA).

BE Safe is an AngularJS web application running on a Node.js/Express API and is deployable across platforms. It accesses the OpenFDA API and allows users to search for drug recalls and adverse reactions. Users can subscribe to alerts and receive notifications of new recalls and reactions. Users can share their results on social media and also submit their own adverse reactions.

## 1. Operational Prototype 

The [BE Safe](https://be-safe.buchanan-edwards.com) prototype can be run on a desktop or mobile browser. Our SSL certificate is bound to that URL but it is an alias to a [Docker container running on AWS](http://besafedocker-envii.elasticbeanstalk.com/).
We also co-deploy to an [Azure Web App](https://be-safe.azurewebsites.net) that we use for testing and staging.

### 1.1 Prototype Installation

The BE Safe application can be run on any platform supporting Node.js. Here is the installation procedure:

#### Standalone Node Installation

Prerequisites

- [A Git client](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v0.12.6 is recommended)

Work from a terminal window

- **Windows**: From the Start menu, select Git > Git bash
- **Mac**: Press Command + Space and type Terminal
- **Linux**: Open a standard terminal window

Clone our GitHub repository.

    $ git clone https://github.com/buchanan-edwards/be-safe.git
    $ cd be-safe

In the `config` directory is a `local-example.json` file. Please **copy or rename** this file to `local.json`. Then, edit this file and set your own OpenFDA API key as well as the AWS settings used for SMTP.

    $ cd config
    $ mv local-example.json local.json
    $ notepad local.json                 (edit the file using notepad)
    $ cd ..

Next, install the dependencies and start the server:

    $ npm install
    $ npm start

Point your browser to <http://localhost:8081/> and use the BE Safe application. Please note that the port can be changed in the `config/defaults.json` file.

#### Docker Installation

The BE Safe application can also be run using Docker technology using the following steps:

1. Install Boot2Docker ([Mac OS X](http://docs.docker.com/mac/started) and [Windows](http://docs.docker.com/windows/started)) or the Docker package ([Linux](http://docs.docker.com/linux/started)).
2. `$ boot2docker ip #` (Write this down for later)
3. `$ boot2docker ssh`
4. `$ docker pull buchananedwards/be-safe`
5. `docker run -p 8081:8081 -e "OPEN_FDA_API_KEY=YOUROPENFDAAPIKEY" -e "AWS_REGION=YOURAWSREGION" -e "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOURAWSACCESSKEYID" -e "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOURAWSSECRETACCESSKEY" buchananedwards/be-safe`

## 2. Solution Approach

Our solution followed these principles:

1. **Team** - Leverage a multi-disciplined team that is technically innovative and has process experience ranging from agile methodologies to user acceptance testing.

2. **Architecture** - Implement a modern UI/API architecture with a Single Page Application (SPA) connected to an independently-testable Application Programming Interface (API).

3. **User-Centric** - Enable our target users to access the application on any device, involving users at every point in our process as well as during usability testing.

4. **DevOps** - Make continuous build, test, and deployment an integral part of the project workflow and couple the results directly into our product backlog.

Each of these principles are discussed below, along with the required points outlined in the RFQ.

### 2.1 The Team

Our team was led by Brian Shafer who was responsible for the overall operation of the prototype team as defined in our project charter. The team included the following GSA 18F Labor Categories.

- Product Manager  
- Technical Architect  
- Interaction Designer / User Researcher / Usability Tester  
- Visual Designer  
- Frontend Web Developer  
- Backend Web Developer  
- DevOps Engineer  
- Security Engineer  
- Delivery Manager  
- Business Analyst

The labor categories and mapping to our GSA Schedule 70 is fully documented and was submitted to eBuy as directed in the RFQ.

The team provided technical competence via an Agile process to achieve the best *product*.

We incorporated the following 18F guiding principles into our approach.

1. **Put the needs of users first** - We had multiple team members running the application during our sprints, providing immediate usability feedback and noting any issues on mobile devices.

2. **Release early, iteratively, and often** - We continuously auto-deployed from our Git development branch so any deployment issues would be known immediately. This gave our sample users a periodically and frequently refreshed build that they could evaluate.

3. **Don’t slow down delivery** - Instead of developing the API first and then the user interface, we worked in parallel, taking a holistic approach so that a working application could be delivered and tested sooner rather than later.

4. **Only do it if it adds value** - We balanced adding new features against the potential for feature bloat and possible user confusion. We focused on the value proposition, delivering core features, and their reliability and efficiency over flash.

5. **Work in the open** - We leveraged only open source code and incorporated open source projects produced by Buchanan & Edwards and available on GitHub into the BE Safe application. Ultimately, we released our work in a public repository.

We interpret this last point, *work in the open*, on a more personal level. During the course of developing this prototype, our team members worked in a single room, sharing ideas in an open forum, and collaborating towards a common goal. We employed pair-programming so that no one person was stuck and had another developer at their side.

### 2.2 The Architecture

We took a modern, best practice architecture view for this prototype. BE Safe is an AngularJS web app that is served by a Node.js server application. This server application provides the API consumed by the AngularJS web app. This approach allowed our API to be tested in isolation from the user interface and is a clean way of separating the user experience from the business logic and database access.

#### 2.2.1 Open Source Technologies

An examination of both our `package.json` and `bower.json` files will reveal all of the technologies used in the BE Safe application. Here are the top technologies employed:

1. **Node.js** - A cross-platform server-side technology that allows us to develop, test, and deploy on Windows, Mac, and Linux systems.
 
2. **Express** - A web framework for Node that provides both our web application as well as our backend API.
 
3. **AngularJS** - A model-view-model framework for creating routable and extensible web applications.
 
4. **Bootstrap** - A CSS framework that provides cross-browser compatible styling and components for a robust user interface.
 
5. **SQLite** - An embedded database that we use for storing subscriptions as well as adverse reaction reports.
 
6. **Bunyan** - A logging facility for Node that is customizable for both development and production.
 
7. **Morgan** - An Express logging facility for tracking all HTTP requests, responses, and errors.
 
8. **Circle CI** - A continuous integration tool that pulls from GitHub, runs tests, and auto-deploys to AWS.
 
9. **Docker** - A container-as-a-service platform for packaging our application in addition to AWS deployment.


### 2.3 Our Users

We took a responsive design approach to our application using the Bootstrap CSS framework to build a cross-browser and cross-device application.

Our business analyst ensured that we used user-centric approaches to our development. We included target users in every aspect of our efforts including envisioning, designing and development. We conducted usability testing with a group of employees that were not part of development. All responses were captured and put into our Jira backlog. Most of the feedback were issues where our application proved less intuitive to an uninitiated user. This was an important part of our software development life cycle.


### 2.4 Deployment and Operations

#### 2.4.1 Continuous Integration

We set up automatic deployment to both Microsoft Azure and AWS Elastic Beanstalk at the very beginning of the project. This deployment approach ensured that we *could* deploy to multiple environments and that our software was platform-independent.

For Azure, we pulled directly from GitHub. Azure proved to be a solid test asset as it was continuously updated on commits. For AWS, we used the Circle CI tool to build, ran automated tests, built the docker container and then deployed to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

#### 2.4.1 Continuous Monitoring

We used AWS CloudWatch for continuous monitoring to ensure a baseline knowledge of our application's performance and to properly manage our security risks.  

#### 2.4.2 Docker Containers

We leveraged Docker to put our application in a container as it integrated nicely with our source control, CI and deployment approaches. Docker met our needs for configuration management, continuous integration and ease of deployment and distribution.  

## 3. Development Approach
Our Agile development approach was tailored to the size, scope and timelines of this effort. Specifically we condensed Google’s Ventures Design Sprint (http://www.gv.com/sprint/) into less than 2 days and conducted daily sprints versus 2 week sprints. 

The BE team was assembled in February and conducted practice sessions to ensure we were ready to work together as an integrated team. The team came back together upon the solicitations release. We used less than 2 days to unpack, sketch and design. On the second day we began daily sprints that included development, releases, demos, retrospectives and user story and backlog updates. At key points we incorporated user feedback including usability and acceptance testing.
